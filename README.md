🪨📄✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors Console Game
A basic command-line implementation of the classic hand game, Rock, Paper, Scissors, written in Python. This project serves as a simple example of using basic input handling, the random module, and conditional logic (if/elif/else) to determine a winner.

✨ Features
Console Interface: The game runs entirely within the terminal.
Randomized Computer Choice: Uses Python's random module to ensure fair play.
Input Validation: Checks if the user's choice is within the valid range (0, 1, or 2).
Clear Logic: Implements the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

🕹️ How to Play
Run the script in your terminal.
The game will prompt you to enter your choice as a number:
0 for Rock 🪨
1 for Paper 📄
2 for Scissors ✂️
The program will display both your choice and the computer's choice, then declare the winner!
